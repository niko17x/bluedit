### Todo:

[*] : Trying to implement "log in" and "register" user through form and firebase. Currently "log in" seems to be submitting the form for a new user registeration.
[*] : The log in modal is opening by default even before the log in button is clicked on. Also, the "close modal" is not working after pressing 'x' on the modal.
[*] : Allow user to register new account by submitting new email and password (store inside state) and pass data to Firebase.
[*] : Working on "create your username and password" modal to register a new user. Currently not doing anything after clicking "continue".
[*] : Form validation error. Getting the error code received by Firebase and using the code to display to user. ie: input email to sign in doesn't exist so let user know that email does not exist in database and to try submitting the form again.
[] : "signinUser" modal error codes foundation set. Work on the "registerUser" modal with the same logic for displaying error codes using setTimeout and also "userCred" modal.
